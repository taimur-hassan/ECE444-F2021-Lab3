**Functional Requirement:** The current function of education pathways is to search for courses based on some filters and keywords and return a list of related courses. A new functional requirement would be to allow students to save profiles of courses for semesters to allow them to plan their schedules for the immediate semester and plan their courses selected in future semesters.

**Non-Functional Requirement:** One non-functional requirement would be to improve the integrity of the results. Currently a number of the coursefinder links are invalid. These links should be checked by developers to ensure they are still valid.
